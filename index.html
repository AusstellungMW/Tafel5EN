    "A summary military court will be held every Friday and Thursday at 10 a.m. at the headquarters of the military government in Wolfenbüttel. The court is public. Admission tickets are available from the police in Wolfenbüttel."

— Announcement by the British Military Government in Wolfenbüttel, August 1945
Source: NLa Wf, 34 Slg 3 <br><br>       

Following the arrival of the U.S. 9th Army, Wolfenbüttel resembled a vast military encampment. Dissatisfaction quickly spread among the local population, as entire streets were occupied by American troops. Without apparent hesitation, the victorious Western forces evicted large Wolfenbüttel families from their homes, confiscating their stoves, furniture, and radios. The villas along Rosenwall were repurposed as housing and administrative offices for U.S. troops. Some American soldiers were also quartered in sections of Wolfenbüttel Castle. However, on April 17, 1945, the combat units withdrew, transferring command to the U.S. military administration.

On June 4, 1945, the British officially assumed control of the military government in Wolfenbüttel. The 827 (K) Military Government Detachment established its headquarters in the district administration building on Bahnhofstraße. The first British military commander for the Landkreis Wolfenbüttel and the Stadtkreis Watenstedt-Salzgitter, as well as the presiding judge of the military court, was Major G. L. P. Plow.

The myth of the "Werwolves"—the belief in armed resistance by German veterans—led the Allies to adopt heightened security measures. To enforce order, the British established a military court within the district administration building. Major Plow presided over cases involving the typical "postwar criminality" of the time. These included early violations of laws and regulations, such as breaching curfews, tearing down or defacing public announcements from the city or military authorities, theft of Allied property, and possession of weapons—the latter often resulting in a death sentence.
